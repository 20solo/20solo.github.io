I'm a writer and college student in Michigan with a lot of busy friends and too many games I want to play. The solution? Solo RPGs! This blog is a collection of my one-player RPG write-ups, along with resource for running your own solo RPGs!

When I'm not playing games I'm usually writing, doing homework, or watching videos of guinea pigs on Instagram.
